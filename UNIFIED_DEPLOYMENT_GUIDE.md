  cloudbuild.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com \
  monitoring.googleapis.com logging.googleapis.com
```

## Deployment Process

### Single Deployment Script

The `/Users/veeraragavalu/solarify-app/deployment/unified-deploy.sh` script handles:

1. **Pre-deployment Validation**: Checks both Firebase and Google Cloud access
2. **Infrastructure Deployment**: Uses Terraform to provision Google Cloud resources
3. **Firebase Services**: Deploys Firestore rules, Firebase Functions, App Hosting
4. **Post-deployment Verification**: Validates both platforms are working correctly
5. **Monitoring Setup**: Configures unified monitoring and alerting

### Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Pre-deployment validation
./deployment/pre-deployment-validation.sh

# 2. Deploy everything with one command
./deployment/unified-deploy.sh --environment production

./deployment/post-deployment-verification.sh
```

### Deployment Architecture

```
Development → Staging → Production
     ↓           ↓         ↓
Firebase &  Firebase &  Firebase &
GCP Staging GCP Staging GCP Production
```

Each environment uses the same deployment process but different project IDs:
- Development: `solarify-dev`
- Staging: `solarify-staging`
- Production: `solarify-prod`

## CI/CD Pipeline

# Dashboard available at: http://localhost:3001
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Authentication Problems

```bash
# Re-authenticate both platforms
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
firebase logout
firebase login
```

#### 2. Project Access Issues

```bash
# Verify project access
gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID
firebase projects:list | grep $PROJECT_ID

# Check IAM permissions
gcloud projects get-iam-policy $PROJECT_ID
```

#### 3. Deployment Failures

```bash
# Run pre-deployment validation
./deployment/pre-deployment-validation.sh

# Check logs
firebase functions:log
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision"
```

#### 4. API Not Enabled

```bash
# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable firebase.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable firestore.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Firebase status
firebase projects:list
firebase use --debug
