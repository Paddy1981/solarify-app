# Performance Optimization Implementation

## Overview
This document tracks the performance optimizations implemented in the Solarify application as part of the production readiness initiative.

## Completed Optimizations

### 1. React Component Optimization (PERF-001) ✅
- **Cart Context**: Implemented `useMemo` and `useCallback` for all cart operations
- **Header Component**: Refactored 432-line monolithic component into 6 modular components
- **Stats Card**: Added `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **All Components**: Applied `useCallback` to event handlers and `useMemo` to expensive calculations

### 2. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading (PERF-002) ✅
- **Dynamic Component Loader**: Created comprehensive utility in `/src/lib/dynamic-loader.tsx`
- **Lazy Dashboard Components**: Implemented in `/src/components/dashboard/lazy-dashboard-components.tsx`
  - All dashboard components are now lazy-loaded
  - Custom loading skeletons for different component types
  - Intersection Observer integration for viewport-based loading
- **Route-Level Lazy Loading**: Added error boundaries and suspense wrappers
- **Bundle Splitting**: Optimized webpack configuration with:
  - Framework chunk (React, Next.js)
  - UI library chunk (Radix UI, Lucide React)
  - Charts chunk (Recharts, D3)
  - Firebase chunk
  - Common vendor chunks
- **Bundle Analysis**: Added scripts and webpack-bundle-analyzer integration

## Performance Improvements

### Bundle Size Reduction
- **Code Splitting**: Separated heavy components into individual chunks
- **Tree Shaking**: Enabled for optimal dead code elimination
- **Dynamic Imports**: Reduced initial bundle size by ~40% (estimated)

### Loading Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Intersection Observer**: Components load 100px before entering viewport
- **Loading Skeletons**: Improved perceived performance with contextual loading states
- **Image Optimization**: WebP/AVIF formats with lazy loading

### Runtime Performance
- **React.memo**: Prevents unnecessary component re-renders
- **useCallback/useMemo**: Optimized expensive operations and callbacks
- **Component Granularity**: Smaller, focused components reduce re-render scope

## Implementation Details

### Key Files Modified
1. `/src/app/homeowner/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated to use lazy components
2. `/src/context/cart-context.tsx` - Optimized with memoization
3. `/src/components/layout/header/` - Modularized into 6 components
4. `/next.config.js` - Advanced bundle splitting configuration
5. `/package.json` - Added performance analysis scripts

### Bundle Chunks Created
- `framework.js` - React, Next.js core
- `ui.js` - Radix UI, Lucide React
- `charts.js` - Recharts, D3
- `firebase.js` - Firebase SDK
- `lib.js` - Date-fns, Zod, React Hook Form
- `vendor.js` - Other node_modules
- `common.js` - Shared app code

### Loading Strategies
- **Above-the-fold**: Critical components load immediately
- **Below-the-fold**: Components lazy load with intersection observer
- **Route-level**: Page components use dynamic imports
- **Feature-level**: Heavy features (MFA, Analytics) load on demand

## Monitoring and Analysis

### Bundle Analysis Commands
```bash
npm run analyze              # Full bundle analysis
npm run analyze:server       # Server-side bundle
npm run analyze:browser      # Client-side bundle
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Lighthouse Score**: Target 90+ for Performance
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 2s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3s
- **Bundle Size**: < 250KB initial load

## Next Steps

### Pending Optimizations (PERF-003)
- Firestore query optimization with proper indexing
- Database connection pooling
- Query result caching

### Monitoring Setup (DEVOPS-002)
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Bundle size monitoring in CI/CD

## Best Practices Established

1. **Lazy Loading**: Use `createDynamicComponent` for heavy components
2. **Memoization**: Always wrap expensive calculations with `useMemo`
3. **Callbacks**: Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to children
4. **Component Size**: Keep components under 100 lines when possible
5. **Bundle Analysis**: Run analysis before major releases
6. **Loading States**: Always provide meaningful loading skeletons

## Testing Performance

### Load Testing
```bash
# Development
npm run dev
# Check Network tab in DevTools for chunk loading

# Production Build
npm run build
npm run start
# Verify bundle splitting and lazy loading
```

### Bundle Analysis
```bash
npm run analyze
# Open client-bundle-report.html and server-bundle-report.html
```
